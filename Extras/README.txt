The files in this folder are the result of the 400 million simulation run for which the results are published in Fender et al., 2026. They act as both examples of the code outputs as well as the means for replicating the results and figures presented in that manuscript. Naturally the raw N15NZInverseCycleXRoutput files are too large to host on github (although they are available on demand), but I have tried to include the resultant .mat files they create from all the other .m scripts. Unfortunately, you can see that I am rather a messy coder and there are quite a lot of these .m files, but they are also pretty extensively commented. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about running the model.
